I'm excited to say that the second edition of my book, [Learning NServiceBus](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-nservicebus-second-edition), has now been published!

[![Learning NServiceBus Second Edition](/images/learning-nservicebus-2ndEd.jpg)](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-nservicebus-second-edition)

The second edition of the book includes the following improvements over the first edition:

-   Completely updated to cover NServiceBus 5.0
-   All-new chapter on the Service Platform (ServiceControl, ServiceInsight, ServicePulse, and ServiceMatrix)
-   More diagrams (these were unfortunately sparse in the first edition)
-   Coverage of V5-specific features (Pipeline, Outbox)
-   Revised and expanded...everything

 All told, there are [roughly 44 additional pages](https://twitter.com/DavidBoike/status/556103930430910465) (over the first edition) of just raw new content.

And perhaps best of all, the new edition includes a foreward from [Udi Dahan](http://www.udidahan.com/) himself, which tells the story of how NServiceBus got its start in the first place, tracing the history from his early days as a programmer to the point where this book has been published in its second edition. It's very humbling for me personally to have his endorsement on my work, and I am very thankful.

Also, as always, so many thanks to everyone at Particular Software who were very helpful during the development of the book, and to my tech reviewers [Daniel Marbach](https://twitter.com/danielmarbach), [Hadi Eskandari](https://twitter.com/hadi_es), [Roy Cornelissen](https://twitter.com/roycornelissen), and [Prashant Brall](https://twitter.com/PrashantBrall), who made sure that you have the best content in your hands possible.

The book is [available for purchase right now](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-nservicebus-second-edition) from the publisher in physical and eBook forms, and will be available via other channels (Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Safari Books Online, etc.) shortly. I hope of course that you buy it, but more importantly, that you find it useful.
