While of course [buying my book](http://www.packtpub.com/build-distributed-software-systems-using-dot-net-enterprise-service-bus/book) is a great way to get started with NServiceBus, absolutely nothing beats formal in-person training. There is no substitute from learning directly from someone who has been there before, who can provide both the info you need and the background behind it, with the ability to ask questions specific to your use case.

This is why I am so excited to be offering [the formal 4-day NServiceBus training course](http://training.ilmservice.com/). The course will be held on December 9-12 at [ILM’s offices](http://ilmservice.com/) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is the official course with the official curriculum originally developed by [Udi Dahan](http://www.udidahan.com/) himself, but updated for all of the new features in NServiceBus V4.

If you have any questions about the course, please [contact me through the training site contact form](http://training.ilmservice.com/Contact) or through the comments on this post and I’ll answer any question I can.

I’m looking forward to meeting some talented developers and hopefully throwing back a tasty beverage or two as well!

We’re also planning to hold more training courses on other topics soon, so be sure to [watch my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/DavidBoike) for updates.
