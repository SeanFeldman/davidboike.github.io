I'm really thrilled that my book has finally been published. I really love NServiceBus and so writing the book was a labor of love.

What's even more exciting is that, thanks to my publisher Packt, 5 lucky winners stand a chance to win digital copies of my book for free!

## How to enter?

 All you need to do is go to [Packt's Learning NServiceBus book page](http://www.packtpub.com/build-distributed-software-systems-using-dot-net-enterprise-service-bus/book "Learning NServiceBus"), look through the product description, table of contents, etc. and then **leave a comment on this blog post to let us know what interests you the most about this book**. Not rocket science. Packt will select the 5 best comments, and those people will receive a digital copy of the book for free!

## Deadline

 You have until Saturday, September 21, 2013 at midnight UTC (that's after Friday is done, or 2013-09-21T00:00:00Z) to enter the contest. The winners will be contacted by Packt via email, so be sure your comment includes a real email address where they can reach you.

Thanks and I hope you enjoy the book!

## Winners

 **The contest is officially over. Thanks everyone for your entries! Here are the winners:**

-   Geert Depickere
