Well [Christopher Columbus was kind of an all around poor example of a human being](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/columbus_day), but the upside is that my publisher is running a [pretty awesome sale](http://bit.ly/1bqvB29) on all of their eBooks, including my book, [Learning NServiceBus](http://www.packtpub.com/build-distributed-software-systems-using-dot-net-enterprise-service-bus/book). Anyone who uses the promotional code COL50 at checkout will get 50% off any eBooks or videos. That's a pretty good deal. Aside from my book, I would also strongly recommend [RavenDB 2.x Beginner's Guide](http://www.packtpub.com/ravendb-2-x-beginners-guide/book) by Khaled Tannir, and [RavenDB High Performance](http://www.packtpub.com/ravendb-high-performance/book) by Brian Ritchie.
