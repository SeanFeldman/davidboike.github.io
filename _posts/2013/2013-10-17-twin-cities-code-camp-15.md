I will be presenting an [Introduction to Service Oriented Architecture](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2013/Sessions.aspx#s24), featuring [NServiceBus](http://particular.net/nservicebus), at the [Twin Cities Code Camp 15](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx) this weekend. The code camp is on the University of Minnesota campus so if you're in the area, I would highly encourage you to come out and see me as well as some [other awesome presentations](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2013/Schedule.aspx). I will be speaking at 12:45 in room 3-180. Personally I'm really looking forward to seeing [Judah Himango](http://twitter.com/judahgabriel), the brains behind the new HTML 5 version of the RavenDB Management Studio, speak about TypeScript. Of course the code camp is entirely free, and I [think you can still register](http://tccc15.eventbrite.com/).

As a bonus, I'll be giving away a free hardcopy of my book, [Learning NServiceBus](http://www.packtpub.com/build-distributed-software-systems-using-dot-net-enterprise-service-bus/book), during my session!

I hope to see you there!
